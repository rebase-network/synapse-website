DApp demo: https://github.com/rebase-network/simplestdapp/

Synapse will inject a object `ckb` into browser `window` object, so you can use method under ckb directly. The following docs will talk about how to use the methods provided by ckb.

**Note**: The sdk will be changed frequently before we publish the production version. If you have any questions, problems and suggestions, do not hesitate to create an issue.

## Methods list

- [ckb.getAddressInfo](/docs/getAddressInfo)
- [ckb.getLiveCells](/docs/getLiveCells)
- [ckb.sign](/docs/sign)
- [ckb.signSend](/docs/signSend)
- [ckb.send](/docs/send)
